# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>
#
# Type must be one of:
#   feat:     A new feature
#   fix:      A bug fix
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   perf:     A code change that improves performance
#   test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#   chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
#   ci:       Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
#
# Scope is optional and can be anything specifying place of the commit change.
#
# Subject should use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed"
#
# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with
# previous behavior.
#
# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also
# the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes.
#
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space
# or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
